= Spring Cloud Data Flow Runtime

Data flow runtime can be deployed and used with _YARN_ in two different
ways, firstly using it directly with a _YARN_ cluster and secondly
letting _Apache Ambari_ deploy it into its cluster as a service.

== Deploying on YARN

The server application is run as a standalone application.  All apps used for streams and tasks will be deployed on the YARN cluster that is targeted by the server.

=== Prerequisites

These requirements are not something yarn runtime needs but generally
what dataflow core needs.

* Redis - Needed for some persisting runtime data.
* Rabbit - If dataflow apps using rabbit bindings are used.
* Kafka - If dataflow apps using kafka bindings are used.
* DB - we currently use embedded H2 database, though any supported
DB can be configured.

=== Download and Extract Distribution

Download the Spring Cloud Data Flow YARN distribution ZIP file which includes the Admin and the Shell apps:

[source,text,subs="attributes"]
----
$ wget http://repo.spring.io/{version-type-lowercase}/org/springframework/cloud/dist/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn-dist/{revnumber-version}/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn-dist-{revnumber-version}.zip
----

Unzip the distribution ZIP file and change to the directory containing the deployment files.

[source,text,subs="attributes"]
----
$ cd spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn-{revnumber-version}
----

=== Configure Settings

Generic runtime settings can changed in `config/servers.yml`. Make
sure Hadoop and Redis are running.
If either one is not running on `localhost` you need to configure them in `config/servers.yml`

=== Start Server
If this is the first time deploying make sure the user that runs
the _Server_ app has rights to create and write to _/dataflow_
directory in `hdfs`. If there is an existing deployment on `hdfs`
remove it using:

[source,text]
----
$ hdfs dfs -rm -R /dataflow
----

Start the Spring Cloud Data Flow Server app for YARN

[source,text]
----
$ ./bin/dataflow-server-yarn
----

=== Connect Shell

start `spring-cloud-dataflow-shell`

[source,text]
----
$ ./bin/dataflow-shell
----

=== Register Applications

By default, the application registry will be empty. If you would like to register all out-of-the-box stream applications built with the RabbitMQ binder in bulk, you can with the following command. For more details, review how to link:http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/{scdf-core-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-dataflow-register-apps.html[register applications].

[source,text]
----
dataflow:>app import --uri http://bit.ly/stream-applications-rabbit-docker
----

=== Create Stream

Create a stream:

[source,text]
----
dataflow:>stream create --name foostream --definition "time|log" --deploy
----

List streams:

[source,text]
----
dataflow:>stream list
╔═══════════╤═════════════════╤════════╗
║Stream Name│Stream Definition│ Status ║
╠═══════════╪═════════════════╪════════╣
║foostream  │time|log         │deployed║
╚═══════════╧═════════════════╧════════╝
----

After some time, destroy the stream:

[source,text]
----
dataflow:>stream destroy --name foostream
----

The YARN application is pushed and started automatically during a stream
deployment process. Once all streams are destroyed the YARN application
will exit.

=== Create Task
Create and launch task:

[source,text]
----
dataflow:>task create --name footask --definition "timestamp"
Created new task 'footask'
dataflow:>task launch --name footask
Launched task 'footask'
----

=== Check YARN App Statuses
Overall app status can be seen from _YARN Resource Manager UI_ or
using _Spring YARN CLI_ which gives more info about running containers
within an app itself.

[source,text]
----
$ ./bin/dataflow-server-yarn-cli shell
----

When stream has been submitted YARN shows it as `ACCEPTED` before its
turned to `RUNNING` state.

[source,text]
----

$ submitted
  APPLICATION ID                  USER          NAME                     QUEUE    TYPE      STARTTIME       FINISHTIME  STATE     FINALSTATUS  ORIGINAL TRACKING URL

$ submitted
  APPLICATION ID                  USER          NAME                     QUEUE    TYPE      STARTTIME       FINISHTIME  STATE    FINALSTATUS  ORIGINAL TRACKING URL

----

More info about internals for stream apps can be queried by
`clustersinfo` and `clusterinfo` commands:

[source,text]
----
$ clustersinfo -a application_1461658614481_0001
  CLUSTER ID
  --------------
  foostream:log
  foostream:time

$ clusterinfo -a application_1461658614481_0001 -c foostream:time
  CLUSTER STATE  MEMBER COUNT
  -------------  ------------
  RUNNING        1
----

After stream is undeployed YARN app should close itself automatically:

[source,text]
----
$ submitted -v
  APPLICATION ID                  USER          NAME                     QUEUE    TYPE      STARTTIME       FINISHTIME      STATE     FINALSTATUS  ORIGINAL TRACKING URL
  ------------------------------  ------------  -----------------------  -------  --------  --------------  --------------  --------  -----------  ---------------------
  application_1461658614481_0001  jvalkealahti  scdstream:app:foostream  default  DATAFLOW  26/04/16 16:27  26/04/16 16:28  FINISHED  SUCCEEDED
----

Launching a task will be shown in `RUNNING` state while app is
executing its batch jobs:

[source,text]
----
$ submitted -v
  APPLICATION ID                  USER          NAME                     QUEUE    TYPE      STARTTIME       FINISHTIME      STATE     FINALSTATUS  ORIGINAL TRACKING URL

== Deploying on AMBARI
Ambari basically automates YARN installation instead of doing it
manually. Also a lot of other configuration steps are automated as
much as possible to easy overall installation process.

=== Install Ambari Server
Generally it is only needed to install `scdf-plugin-hdp` plugin into
ambari server which adds needed service definitions.

[source,text,subs="attributes"]
----
[root@ambari-1 ~]# yum -y install ambari-server
[root@ambari-1 ~]# ambari-server setup -s
[root@ambari-1 ~]# wget -nv http://repo.spring.io/yum-{version-type-lowercase}-local/scdf/1.0/scdf-{version-type-lowercase}-1.0.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/scdf-{version-type-lowercase}-1.0.repo
[root@ambari-1 ~]# yum -y install scdf-plugin-hdp
[root@ambari-1 ~]# ambari-server start
----

[NOTE]
====
Ambari plugin only works for redhat6 based systems for now.
====

=== Deploy Data Flow

When you create your cluste and choose a stack, make sure that
`redhat6` section contains repository named `SCDF-1.0` and that it
points to `http://repo.spring.io/yum-{version-type-lowercase}-local/scdf/1.0`.

From services choose `Spring Cloud Dataflow` and `Kafka`. `Hdfs`,
`Yarn` and `Zookeeper` are forced dependencies.

Then in _Customize Services_ what is really left for user to do is to 
add address for redis(as it’s required). Everything else is automatically
configured. Technically it also allows you to switch to use rabbit by
leaving Kafka out and defining rabbit settings there. But generally
use of Kafka is a good choice.

[NOTE]
====
We also install H2 DB as service so that it can be accessed from every
node.
