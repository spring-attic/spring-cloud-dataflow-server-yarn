= Spring Cloud Data Flow Runtime

Data flow runtime can be deployed and used with _YARN_ in two different
ways, firstly using it directly with a _YARN_ cluster and secondly
letting _Apache Ambari_ deploy it into its cluster as a service.
Difference between these two deployment types is that _YARN_ only
provides a raw runtime environment for containers where user is required
to setup all needed dependencies while _Apache Ambari_ will try to
focus on easy deployment where minimum set of required services exist
in ambari managed cluster.

[[yarn-deploying-on-yarn]]
== Deploying on YARN

The server application is run as a standalone application. All
applications used for streams and tasks will be deployed on the YARN
cluster that is targeted by the server.

=== Prerequisites

These requirements are not something yarn runtime needs but generally
what dataflow core needs.

* Rabbit - If dataflow apps using rabbit bindings are used.
* Kafka - If dataflow apps using kafka bindings are used.
* DB - we currently use embedded H2 database, though any supported
DB can be configured.

=== Download and Extract Distribution

Download the Spring Cloud Data Flow YARN distribution ZIP file which
includes the Server and the Shell apps:

[source,text,subs="attributes"]
----
$ wget https://repo.spring.io/{version-type-lowercase}/org/springframework/cloud/dist/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn-dist/{revnumber-version}/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn-dist-{revnumber-version}.zip
----

Unzip the distribution ZIP file and change to the directory containing the deployment files.

[source,text,subs="attributes"]
----
$ cd spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn-{revnumber-version}
----

=== Configure Settings

Generic runtime settings can changed in `config/servers.yml`.
Dedicated section <<yarn-configure-settings>> contains detailed
information about configuration.

`servers.yml` file is a central place to share common configuration as
it is added to Boot based jvm processes via option
`-Dspring.config.location=servers.yml`.

=== Start Server
If this is the first time deploying make sure the user that runs
the _Server_ app has rights to create and write to _/dataflow_
directory in `hdfs`. If there is an existing deployment on `hdfs`
remove it using:

[source,text]
----
$ hdfs dfs -rm -R /dataflow
----

Start the Spring Cloud Data Flow Server app for YARN

[source,text]
----
$ ./bin/dataflow-server-yarn
----

=== Connect Shell

start `spring-cloud-dataflow-shell`

[source,text]
----
$ ./bin/dataflow-shell
----

Shell in a distribution package contains extension commands for a
`hdfs` file system.

[source,text]
----
dataflow:>hadoop fs 
hadoop fs cat              hadoop fs copyFromLocal    hadoop fs copyToLocal      hadoop fs expunge          
hadoop fs ls               hadoop fs mkdir            hadoop fs mv               hadoop fs rm               
dataflow:>hadoop fs ls /

----

[TIP]
====
You can configure server address automatically by placing it in
a configuration using key `dataflow.uri`.
====

=== Register Applications
By default, the application registry will be empty. If you would like
to register all out-of-the-box stream applications built with the RabbitMQ
binder in bulk, you can with the following command. For more details,
review how to <<streams.adoc#spring-cloud-dataflow-register-apps, register applications>>.

[source,text]
----
dataflow:>app import --uri https://bit.ly/stream-applications-rabbit-maven
----

==== Sourcing Applications from HDFS
YARN integration also allows you to store registered applications
directly in HDFS instead of relying on `maven` or any other
resolution. Only thing to change during a registration is to use
`hdfs` address as shown below.

[source,text]
----
dataflow:>app register --name ftp --type sink --uri hdfs:/dataflow/artifacts/repo/ftp-sink-kafka-1.0.0.RC1.jar
----

=== Create Stream

Create a stream:

[source,text]
----
dataflow:>stream create --name foostream --definition "time|log" --deploy
----

List streams:

[source,text]
----
dataflow:>stream list
╔═══════════╤═════════════════╤════════╗
║Stream Name│Stream Definition│ Status ║
╠═══════════╪═════════════════╪════════╣
║foostream  │time|log         │deployed║
╚═══════════╧═════════════════╧════════╝
----

After some time, destroy the stream:

[source,text]
----
dataflow:>stream destroy --name foostream
----

The YARN application is pushed and started automatically during a stream
deployment process. Once all streams are destroyed the YARN application
will exit.

=== Create Task
Create and launch task:

[source,text]
----
dataflow:>task create --name footask --definition "timestamp"
Created new task 'footask'
dataflow:>task launch --name footask
Launched task 'footask'
----

=== Using YARN Cli
Overall app status can be seen from _YARN Resource Manager UI_ or
using _Spring YARN CLI_ which gives more info about running containers
within an app itself.

[source,text]
----
$ ./bin/dataflow-server-yarn-cli shell
----

==== Check YARN App Statuses

When stream has been submitted YARN shows it as `ACCEPTED` before its
turned to `RUNNING` state.

[source,text]
----

$ submitted

----

More info about internals for stream apps can be queried by
`clustersinfo` and `clusterinfo` commands:

[source,text]
----
$ clustersinfo -a application_1461658614481_0001
  CLUSTER ID
  --------------
  foostream:log

$ clusterinfo -a application_1461658614481_0001 -c foostream:time
  CLUSTER STATE  MEMBER COUNT
  -------------  ------------
  RUNNING        1
----

After stream is undeployed YARN app should close itself automatically:

[source,text]
----
$ submitted -v
  APPLICATION ID                  USER          NAME                     QUEUE    TYPE      STARTTIME       FINISHTIME      STATE     FINALSTATUS  ORIGINAL TRACKING URL

[[yarn-deploying-on-ambari]]
== Deploying on AMBARI
Ambari basically automates YARN installation instead of requiring user
to do it manually. Also a lot of other configuration steps are automated as
much as possible to easy overall installation process.

There is no difference on components deployed into ambari comparing of
a manual usage with a separate YARN cluster. With ambari we simply package
needed dataflow components into a rpm package so that it can be managed as
an ambari service. After that ambari really only manage a runtime
configuration of those components.

=== Install Ambari Server
Generally it is only needed to install `scdf-plugin-hdp` plugin into
ambari server which adds needed service definitions.

[source,text,subs="attributes"]
----
[root@ambari-1 ~]# yum -y install ambari-server
[root@ambari-1 ~]# ambari-server setup -s
[root@ambari-1 ~]# wget -nv https://repo.spring.io/yum-{version-type-lowercase}-local/scdf/1.0/scdf-{version-type-lowercase}-1.0.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/scdf-{version-type-lowercase}-1.0.repo
[root@ambari-1 ~]# yum -y install scdf-plugin-hdp
[root@ambari-1 ~]# ambari-server start
----

[NOTE]
====
Ambari plugin only works for redhat6/redhat7 and related centos based systems for now.
====

=== Deploy Data Flow

When you create your cluster and choose a stack, make sure that
`redhat6` or/and `redhat7` sections contains repository named
`SCDF-1.0` and that it points to
`https://repo.spring.io/yum-{version-type-lowercase}-local/scdf/1.0`.

`Ambari 2.4` contains major rewrites for stack definitions and how it
is possible to integrate with those from external contributions. Our
plugin will eventually integrate via extensions or management packs,
but for now you need to choose stack marked as a _Default Version
Definition_ which contains correct yum repository. For example with
`HDP 2.5` you have two default choices, _HDP-2.5.0.0_ and _HDP-2.5
(Default Version Definition)_. As mentioned you need to pick latter.
With older ambari versions you don't have these new options.

From services choose `Spring Cloud Data Flow` and `Kafka`. `Hdfs`,
`Yarn` and `Zookeeper` are forced dependencies.

[NOTE]
====
With `Kafka` you can do "one-click" installation while using `Rabbit`
you need to provide appropriate connection settings as `Rabbit` is not
part of a Ambari managed service.
====

Then in _Customize Services_ what is really left for user to do is to
customise settings if needed. Everything else is automatically
configured. Technically it also allows you to switch to use rabbit by
leaving Kafka out and defining rabbit settings there. But generally
use of Kafka is a good choice.

[NOTE]
====
We also install H2 DB as service so that it can be accessed from every
node.
====

=== Using Configuration
`servers.yml` file is also used to store common configuration with
Ambari. Settings in _Advanced scdf-site_ and _Custom scdf-site_ are
used to dynamically create a this file which is then copied over to
hdfs when needed application files are deployd.

Every additional entry added via _Custom scdf-site_ is added into
`servers.yml` as is and overrides everything else in it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If ambari configuration is modified, you need to delete
`/dataflow/apps/stream/app` and `/dataflow/apps/task/app` directories
from hdfs for new settings to get applied. Files in above directories
will not get overridden including generated `servers.yml` config file.
====

==== Change Datasource
Ambari managed service defaults to `H2` database. We currently support
using `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL` and `HSQLDB` as external datasources.
Custom datasource configuration can be applied via _Custom scdf-site_
as shown in below screenshot. After these settings are modified, all
related services needs to be restarted.

.Custom Datasource Config
image::{dataflow-server-yarn-asciidoc}/images/ambari-custom-scdf-site-dbconfig.png[Custom Datasource Config, scaledwidth="50%"]

[NOTE]
====
Managed service _SCDF H2 Database_ can be stopped and put in a
maintenance mode after custom datasource settings has been added.
====

[[yarn-configure-settings]]
== Configuring Runtime Settings and Environment
This section describes how settings related to running YARN
application can be modified.

=== Generic App Settings
All applications whether those are stream apps or task apps can be
centrally configured with `servers.yml` as that file is passed to apps
using `--spring.config.location='servers.yml'`.

=== Configuring Application Resources
Stream and task processes for application master and containers can be
further tuned by setting memory and cpu settings. Also java options
allow to define actual jvm options.

[source,text]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    deployer:
      yarn:
        app:
          streamappmaster:
            memory: 512m
            virtualCores: 1
            javaOpts: "-Xms512m -Xmx512m"
          streamcontainer:
            priority: 5
            memory: 256m
            virtualCores: 1

          taskcontainer:
            priority: 10
            memory: 256m
            virtualCores: 1
            javaOpts: "-Xms64m -Xmx256m"
----

=== Configure Base Directory
Base directory where all needed files are kept defaults to `/dataflow`
and can be changed using `baseDir` property.

[source,text]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    deployer:
      yarn:
        app:
          baseDir: /dataflow
----

[[yarn-pre-populate]]
=== Pre-populate Applications
Spring Cloud Data Flow app registration is based on URI's with various
different endpoints. As mentioned in section <<yarn-how-it-works>> all
applications are first stored into hdfs before application container
is launched. Server can use `http`, `file`, `http` and `maven` based
uris as well direct `hdfs` uris.

It is possible to place these applications directly into HDFS and
register application based on that URI.

=== Configure Logging
Logging for all components is done centrally via `servers.yml` file
using normal Spring Boot properties.

[source,text]
----
logging:
  level:
    org.apache.hadoop: INFO
    org.springframework.yarn: INFO
----

=== Global YARN Memory Settings
YARN Nodemanager is continously tracking how much memory is used by
individual YARN containers. If containers are using more memory than
what the configuration allows, containers are simply killed by a
Nodemanager. Application master controlling the app lifecycle is given
a little more freedom meaning that Nodemanager is not that aggressive
when making a desicion when a container should be killed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These are global cluster settings and cannot be changed during an
application deployment.
====

Lets take a quick look of memory related settings in YARN cluster and
in YARN applications. Below xml config is what a default vanilla
Apache
Hadoop uses for memory related settings. Other distributions may have
different defaults.


*yarn.nodemanager.pmem-check-enabled*::

Enables a check for physical memory of a process. This check if
enabled is directly tracking amount of memory requested for a YARN
container. 

*yarn.nodemanager.vmem-check-enabled*::

Enables a check for virtual memory of a process. This setting is one
which is usually causing containers of a custom YARN applications to
get killed by a node manager. Usually the actual ratio between
physical and virtual memory is higher than a default `2.1` or bugs in
a OS is causing wrong calculation of a used virtual memory.

*yarn.nodemanager.vmem-pmem-ratio*::

Defines a ratio of allowed virtual memory compared to physical memory.
This ratio simply defines how much virtual memory a process can use
but the actual tracked size is always calculated from a physical
memory limit.

*yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb*::

Defines a minimum allocated memory for container.

+
[NOTE]
====
This setting also indirectly defines what is the actual physical
memory limit requested during a container allocation. Actual physical
memory limit is always going to be multiple of this setting rounded to
upper bound. For example if this setting is left to default `1024` and
container is requested with `512M`, `1024M` is going to be used.
However if requested size is `1100M`, actual size is set to `2048M`.
====

*yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb*::

Defines a maximum allocated memory for container.

*yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb*::

Defines how much memory a node controlled by a node manager is allowed
to allocate. This setting should be set to amount of which OS is able
give to YARN managed processes in a way which doesn't cause OS to
swap, etc.

=== Configure Kerberos
Enabling kerberos is relatively easy when existing kerberized
cluster exists. Just like with every other hadoop related service,
use a specific user and a keytab.

[source,text]
----
spring:
  hadoop:
    security:
      userPrincipal: scdf/_HOST@HORTONWORKS.COM
      userKeytab: /etc/security/keytabs/scdf.service.keytab
      authMethod: kerberos
      namenodePrincipal: nn/_HOST@HORTONWORKS.COM
      rmManagerPrincipal: rm/_HOST@HORTONWORKS.COM
      jobHistoryPrincipal: jhs/_HOST@HORTONWORKS.COM

----

[NOTE]
====
When using ambari, configuration and keytab generation are
fully automated.
====

==== Working with Kerberized Kafka

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently released kafka based apps doesn't work with cluster
where zookeeper and kafka itself are configured to for kerberos
authentication. Workaround is to use rabbit based apps or
build stream apps based on new kafka binder having support
for kerberized kafka.
====

After a kafka based stream app has a kerberos support, some settings
in ambari's kafka configuration needs to be changed. Effectively
`listeners` and `security.inter.broker.protocol` needs to use
_SASL_PLAINTEXT_. Also binder needs to be able to create topics, thus
`scdf` user needs to be added to a kafka's super users.

[source,text]
----
listeners=SASL_PLAINTEXT://localhost:6667
security.inter.broker.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT
super.users=user:kafka;user:scdf
----

Additional configs are needed for binder and sasl config.

[source,text]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    stream:
      kafka:
        binder:
          configuration:
            security:
              protocol: SASL_PLAINTEXT
spring:
  cloud:
    deployer:
      yarn:
        app:
          streamcontainer:
            saslConfig: "-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/etc/scdf/conf/scdf_kafka_jaas.conf"
----

Where `scdf_kafka_jaas.conf` looks something like shown below.

[source,text]
----
KafkaClient {
   com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
   useKeyTab=true
   keyTab="/etc/security/keytabs/scdf.service.keytab"
   storeKey=true
   useTicketCache=false
   serviceName="kafka"
   principal="scdf/sandbox.hortonworks.com@HORTONWORKS.COM";
};
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
When ambari is kerberized via its wizard, everything else is
automatically configured except kafka settings for a `super.users`,
`listeners` and `security.inter.broker.protocol`.
====

=== Configure Hdfs HA
Generic settings for dataflow components to work with
HA setup can be seen below where id is set to `mycluster`.

[source,text]
----
spring:
  hadoop:
    fsUri: hdfs://mycluster:8020
    config:
      dfs.ha.automatic-failover.enabled=True
      dfs.nameservices=mycluster
      dfs.client.failover.proxy.provider.mycluster=org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.ha.ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider
      dfs.ha.namenodes.mycluster=nn1,nn2
      dfs.namenode.rpc-address.mycluster.nn2=ambari-3.localdomain:8020
      dfs.namenode.rpc-address.mycluster.nn1=ambari-2.localdomain:8020
----

[NOTE]
====
When using ambari and Hdfs HA setup, configuration is fully automated.
====

=== Configure Database
On default a dataflow server will start embedded H2 database
using in-memory storage and effectively using configuration.

[source,text]
----
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:19092/mem:dataflow
    username: sa
    password:
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
----

Distribution package contains a bundled self-contained
H2 executable which can be used instead. This allows
to persist data throughout server restarts and is not
limited to single host.

[source,text]
----
./bin/dataflow-server-yarn-h2 --dataflow.database.h2.directory=/var/run/scdf/data 
----

[source,text]
----
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:tcp://neo:19092/dataflow
    username: sa
    password:
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
With external H2 instance you cannot use `localhost`, instead
use a real hostname.
====

[NOTE]
====
Port can be changed using property `dataflow.database.h2.port`.
====

This bundled H2 database is also used in ambari to have a default
out of a box functionality. Any database supported by a dataflow
itself can be used by changing `datasource` settings. 

[[yarn-how-it-works]]
== How YARN Deployment Works
When YARN application is deployed into a YARN cluster it consists of
two parts, _Application Master_ and _Containers_. Application master
is a control program responsible of handling applications lifecycle
and allocation of containers. Containers are then where a real heavy
lifting is done. In case of a stream there is always minimum of 3
containers, one for application master, one for sink and one for
source. When running tasks there is always one application master and
one container running a particular task.

Needed application files are pushed into hdfs automatically when
needed. After stream and task is used once hdfs directory structure
would like like shown above.

----

[NOTE]
====
`/dataflow/apps` can deleted in case application version is changed or
configuration related to `servers.yml` is modified. Once created these
files are not overridden.
====

Application artifacts are cached under `/dataflow/artifacts/cache`
directory.

[source,text]

/dataflow/artifacts/cache/time-source-rabbit-1.0.0.RC1.jar
/dataflow/artifacts/cache/timestamp-task-1.0.0.RC1.jar
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Artifact caching is happening on two levels, firstly on a local
disk where server is running, and secondly in a hdfs cache directory.
If working with snapshots or own development, it may be required to wipe
out `/dataflow/artifacts/cache` directory and do a server restart.
====

[[yarn-troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting
YARN is fantastic runtime environment for running various workflows
but when things don't work excatly as it was planned, it may be a little
bit of a tedious process to find out what went wrong. This section
tries to provide instructions how to troubleshoot various issues
causing abnormal behaviour.

When something is about to get launched into yarn, a generic procedure
goes like this:

* Client is requesting resources(cpu and memory) for an application master.
* Application master is started as an jvm process controlling
  lifecycle of a yarn application as whole.
* Application master is requesting resources(cpu and memory) for its
  containers where real work is executed.
* Containers are executed as a jvm processes.

There are various places where things can go wrong in this flow:

* YARN resource scheduler will not allocate resources for a container
  possibly due to overallocation or misconfiguration.
* YARN will kill container because it thinks that a container is
  abusing requested amount of memory.
* JVM process itself dies either by abnormal behaviour or OOM errors
  caused by a wrong jvm options.

Log files are the most obvious place to look errors. YARN application
itself writes log files name `Appmaster.stdout`, `Appmaster.stderr`,
`Container.stdout` and `Container.stderr` under yarn's application
logging directory. Also yarn's own logs for _Resource Manager_ and
especially for _Node Manager_ contains additional information when
i.e. containers are getting killed by yarn itself.

== Using Sandboxes
Sandboxes are a single VM images to ease testing and demos without
going through a full multi-machine cluster setup. However these images
have a natural restrictions of resources which are a cornerstone of
YARN to be able to run applications on it. With same limitations and a
carefull configuration it is possible to install Spring Cloud Data
Flow on those sandboxes. In this section we try to provide some
instructions how this can be accomplished.
