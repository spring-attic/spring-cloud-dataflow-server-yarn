Spring Cloud Data Flow for Apache YARN is a cloud-native orchestration service for composable 
data microservices on [Apache YARN](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.1/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html). With Spring Cloud Data Flow, 
developers can create and orchestrate data pipelines for common use cases such as data ingest, real-time analytics, and data import/export.

Spring Cloud Data Flow for Apache YARN offers a collection of patterns and best practices for data 
microservices running as streaming and batch data pipelines in Apache YARN.

## Features

* Consume streaming and batch data microservices as maven artifacts
* Create, unit-test, troubleshoot and manage data microservices in isolation
* Develop using: DSL, Shell, REST-APIs, Dashboard, and Flo
* Take advantage of Apache YARN value-adds such as metrics, security, logging, health checks, and remote management at each data microservice level
* Scale stream and batch pipelines through Spring Cloud Data Flow's `yarn-cli`

## Quick Start

Step 1 - [Download](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#_download_and_extract_distribution) Spring Cloud Data Flow's Apache YARN Server and Shell Applications

Step 2 - Start the [necessary peripherals](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#_prerequisites)

Step 3 - Start Spring Cloud Data Flow's [YARN Server](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#_start_server) Application

Step 4 - [Run and Connect](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#_connect_shell) the Shell Application

Step 5 - Register [Stream and Task](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-yarn/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#_register_applications) applications

Step 6 - Create **‘ticktock’** Stream
```
dataflow:>stream create ticktock --definition "time | hdfs --rollover=1000" --deploy
```

Step 7 - Verify **‘ticktock’** Results under `/tmp/hdfs-sink/` folder

Step 8 - Launch Dashboard at: http://&lt;SCDF_SERVER_HOST&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;/dashboard
